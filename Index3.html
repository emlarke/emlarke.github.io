Lucy and Rosie are one of a kind. They are each others best friends and are attached at the hip. They love to play with their toys together and enjoy each others company. Sometime they do fight and when they fight its very hard to break them up. I never knew pugs can have an aggressive side to them however, I was proven wrong when I saw them attack each other. They usually fight over food or the bones my mother gives them.
