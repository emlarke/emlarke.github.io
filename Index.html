<p>Meet <i>Lucy and Rosie</i>. Two pugs, living large in Connecticut while also having a family that loves them very much. Hi! I'm Emma and I'm a college student who lives in Maine but has two little pugs living back at home. My pugs are what I look forward to most when I come back during my breaks. It's always tough leaving them when I have to go back to school but as soon as I leave I'm just another day closer to seeing them again. I wouldn't want to own any other dog, pugs are unique, smelly, and are like real life cartoons. Lucy and Rosie are very different from each other. Click on the links to see why!</p>
