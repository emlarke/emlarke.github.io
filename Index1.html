<H1> <b> Meet Lucy </b> </H1>
<body>
Lucy is a 5 year old fawn pug; born in Brooklyn, New York! She now lives in a lovely family household located in Fair field County, Connecticut. Even though Lucy is such a fun spirited dog, she is also the laziest. As funny as it sounds she is not a morning dog, she never likes to be woken up. She loves to snuggle with her sister Rosie and eat a lot of food. Lucy is the social dog of the family, as she gets along with almost every other dog and absolutely loves every human being. :)
