<DIV>
    Meet Rosie! Rosie is the little black furred runt of the family. She is a year younger than her older sister Lucy, being just 4 years old. Rosie is so much more different from Lucy.
</DIV>
<Div>
Rosie, is introverted compared to energetic and friendly Lucy. Rosie doesn't like any other dog besides Lucy and is
actually afraid of other animals. She even has a weird eating schedule. Rosie only eats at night, she never eats in the
morning.
</DIV>
<Div>
Rosie also only really likes our family... that being my mom, my dad, my two sisters and myself. Rosie favors
my mom out of everyone though, they have a close relationship. Rosie is a one of a kind pug, she's smaller than most and shy unlike other pugs. However, we love her very much.
